	Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.
	Python’s standard urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP capabilities you need, but the API is thoroughly broken. It was built for a different time — and a different web. It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks.
	
	Things shouldn’t be this way. Not in Python.},
